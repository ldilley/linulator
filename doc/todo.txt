1.) Add network functionality (telnet)
2.) Add command parsing/implement some commands
3.) Add filesystem support
4.) Use iptables/ipfw in howto to redirect traffic to an arbitrary high-level port from TCP 22 and 23
5.) Add SSH server support
6.) Add chroot() support?
7.) Test on windows (#ifdef WIN32, don't call setuid()/setgid() and fork()). Network code will likely need porting as well.
